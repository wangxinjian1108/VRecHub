# Update Submodule

Use this skill when the user asks to bring one submodule forward to its latest upstream commit.

## Inputs

- Submodule name or full path

## Workflow

1. Resolve the full submodule path from `.gitmodules`.
2. Verify the directory exists.
3. Update with `git submodule update --init --remote thirdparty/<name>`.
4. Inspect `git diff --submodule thirdparty/<name>`.
5. If nothing changed, report that it is already up to date and stop.
6. Ask whether the image should also be rebuilt if that was not already specified.
7. If rebuild is wanted:
   - verify `docker/<name>/Dockerfile` exists
   - verify `.github/workflows/docker-<name>.yml` exists
   - trigger the workflow manually with `gh`, or push a commit that will match the path filters
8. Stage only the submodule pointer change unless other related repo files truly changed.
9. Commit with `feat: update <name> to latest` unless the user asked for different wording.
10. Push and watch CI if a workflow was triggered.
11. If CI fails because the upstream repo now needs Dockerfile changes, fix those and retry up to 3 rounds.

## Guardrails

- Do not silently rebuild if the user wanted a pointer-only refresh
- Do not touch unrelated submodules
- Call out upstream breakage explicitly when the new revision is incompatible with the existing image

## Report

Report:

- old and new submodule revisions
- whether an image rebuild was triggered
- final CI status
- any upstream incompatibilities that still need work
